This project focused on data presentation and visuals for the topic of Airline Safety. 
The color scheme and reason for the color chosen:   For the presentation and visuals, I have decided to stay with a palette of colors that is white, gray, and blue for most of the slides. These colors are calming with a minimalist color spectrum so that the visuals would be eye catching without causing stress or panic. 
I wanted to display through various visuals that include bar charts, line charts, and a donut chart that shows the safety of airline travel.   For the first bar chart, I am explaining what the air travel fatalities that were documented from 1989 to 1999.  The second bar chart shows the difference of the fatalities from 2000 to the year 2014.  We can see instantly that the lines are reduced in size.  With that reduction, we look at slide 5 that has the FARS vehicle fatalities in a donut chart just for the year 2015, compared with the airline fatalities that took place over the decades. On the next bar chart, I would present to the low chance of accidents occurring for every 100,000 departures which will represent the likelihood of an accident when traveling by air.   For the line chart for accidents and fatalities in the U.S., I wanted to show how overtime the numbers have dropped and remain to be low. 
After I have presented the statistics surrounding air travel and economic hurdles, I wanted to provide statements and observations to help reverse the image of dangerous air travel by utilizing the information that was provided. With these statements, the executive team may have some insight on how to approach the media, customers, and stakeholders in the future.
